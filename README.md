Project: Mobility patterns/events in Switzerland with Twitter
Description: Using geolocated tweets in the Swiss area, we could work on:
- reconstructing mobility flows of the users
  get insights into high-frequency migration patterns (e.g., the “frontaliers” who commute from France to Geneva everyday; Germans who commute to Zurich; etc.)
  detect changes in migration patterns when, e.g., a new Alpine tunnel gets opened (GBT) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthard_Base_Tunnel (e.g., according to this NZZ article, the Gotthard in particular is expected to be a game changer for the relations between the German and Italian parts of CH)
- detecting events (date, location, positive or negative sentiment)
